# 🧠 Decision Fatigue Simulator

An interactive web-based simulator that demonstrates **decision fatigue** — a psychological phenomenon where repeated decision-making reduces cognitive performance, accuracy, and confidence.

Instead of testing knowledge or reflexes, this project focuses on **mental load**, adaptability, and experiential learning.

---

## 🌐 Live Concept
Users make a series of simple choices.  
As decisions accumulate:
- Time pressure increases
- Number of options grows
- UI introduces subtle cognitive stress
- Fatigue level rises dynamically

The goal is not to win — but to **experience** decision fatigue.

---

## ✨ Features
- Progressive decision rounds
- Adaptive difficulty based on user behavior
- Fatigue meter with visual feedback
- Reaction-time based fatigue calculation
- Cognitive state summary at the end
- Fully browser-based
- Responsive & lightweight

---

## 🧩 Why This Project Is Unique
- Not a quiz or puzzle game
- No right/wrong answers
- No hidden logic or tricks
- Inspired by real psychological concepts
- Focuses on experience over scoring

This makes it suitable for **educational use, research demos, and portfolio showcasing**.
