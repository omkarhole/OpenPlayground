## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Plan Ahead** - Obstacles spawn slowly, giving you time to find safe paths

3. **Be Patient** - The game is slower (6 ticks) so take your time to think
4. **Predict AI** - Red snakes move toward nearby food

## ⚡ Game Speed

The game runs at **6 ticks** - meaning the snake only moves every 6 frames. This gives you:
- ✅ More time to react
- ✅ More time to plan
- ✅ Better control precision
- ✅ Less frustration!

---

## 🌱 Obstacle Spawning

Obstacles don't all appear at once! Instead:
- **Start:** Only 2 rocks + 1 hole on the board
- **During:** New obstacles spawn slowly (every ~3 seconds)
- **Max:** Up to 15 rocks + 10 holes eventually

This progressive difficulty means:
- ✅ Easy start to learn controls
- ✅ Time to get comfortable
- ✅ Challenge increases gradually
- ✅ Always have space to move

---

## 🎮 Multiplayer Mode (Optional)

For multiplayer with other players:
1. Install Node.js
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in multiple browsers
5. Each player enters their name and controls their own snake
