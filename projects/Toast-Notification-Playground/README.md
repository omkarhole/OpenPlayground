# Toast Notification Playground

A simple web app to demonstrate toast notifications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Display customizable toast notifications
- Multiple notification types (success, error, info, warning)
- Auto-dismiss and manual close
- Responsive design

## File Structure
```
projects/Toast-Notification-Playground/
├── app.js        # Main JavaScript logic for notifications
├── index.html    # Demo page for the playground
├── style.css     # Styles for toast notifications and layout
```

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Interact with the demo to trigger toast notifications.
3. Customize the code in `app.js` and `style.css` to fit your needs.

## How It Works
- Toasts are dynamically created and styled using JavaScript and CSS.
- Each toast can be configured for type, message, and duration.
- Toasts stack and auto-dismiss after a set time, or can be closed manually.

## Customization
- Edit `app.js` to change notification logic or add new types.
- Modify `style.css` for custom colors, animations, or layouts.
