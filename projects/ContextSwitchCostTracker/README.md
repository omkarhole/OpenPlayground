![Project Icon](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon@3.5.0/icons/Business/bar-chart-groupped-line.svg)

**FocusGuard** is a productivity utility designed to quantify the hidden costs of multitasking ("context switching") and estimate the risk of missing deadlines based on historical performance.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Context Switch Tracker
Measure the "Focus Tax" you pay every time you switch tasks.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitors your active session duration.
- **Focus Guard**: Automatically detects when you switch tabs, minimize the window, or lose focus.
- **Tax Calculation**: Adds a penalty (default 15 mins) to your "Focus Tax" for every interruption, helping you visualize the true cost of distractions.
- **Session Log**: Keeps a running history of your focus interruptions.

### 2. Deadline Risk Estimator
A simple heuristic tool to calculate how risky a deadline is.
- **Input Factors**: Takes into account your raw task estimation, your history of delays (optimism bias), and available buffer time.
- **Visual Risk Score**: Provides a percentage-based risk score and a clear "Low/Medium/High" risk assessment with actionable advice.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Modern "Glassmorphism" design, CSS Variables, Flexbox/Grid layouts, and responsive media queries.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Object-Oriented logic for the `ContextTracker` and `RiskEstimator` classes.
