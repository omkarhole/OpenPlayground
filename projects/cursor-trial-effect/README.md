**Cursor Trial Effect**

Small demo showing a 3D gallery / cursor trail experiments. This folder contains a few lightweight demos that animate images in 3D space and a separate cursor-trail effect.

**Overview:**
- **Purpose:**: Demonstrates animated, perspective-based gallery visuals and a mouse-following image trailer effect.
- **Approach:**: Uses CSS custom properties + keyframes for the 3D gallery and GSAP for the cursor trailer animations.

**Files changed / added:**
- **Index (gallery):**: [projects/cursor-trial-effect/index.html](projects/cursor-trial-effect/index.html) — main page containing the 3D gallery and inline SVG placeholders (was previously using remote images which caused 403s).
- **Script (trail):**: [projects/cursor-trial-effect/script.js](projects/cursor-trial-effect/script.js) — externalized JS for the cursor-trail effect (moved out of the HTML to avoid MIME/404 issues).

**What I fixed:**
- **404 / MIME for `script.js`:**: The inline script was extracted to `script.js` and the HTML now references it via `<script src="script.js"></script>` so browsers no longer report a 404/MIME error for that file.
- **Remote image 403s:**: External Imgur images were triggering 403 (forbidden) responses during testing. I replaced those with inline SVG placeholders in `index.html`. If you prefer real photos, add them to `projects/cursor-trial-effect/images/` and update the `src` attributes accordingly.
- **favicon 404:**: Added an inline SVG data-URI favicon in the HTML head to prevent requests for `/favicon.ico` that returned 404 on some servers.

**How to run locally:**
- Open the demo with a local HTTP server (recommended) or use VS Code Live Server. Example using Python 3 from the project root:

```
python -m http.server 5504
# then open http://127.0.0.1:5504/projects/cursor-trial-effect/index.html
```

**Notes & troubleshooting:**
- If you still see 403s for images, it means the page is trying to load remote images that block hotlinking. Use local images instead.
- The console message "Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received." is usually caused by a browser extension, not the page itself.
- If you want real photographic assets copied into the repo, I can add an `images/` folder and update `index.html` to point to local files.

**Next steps (optional):**
- Replace SVG placeholders with local JPG/PNG assets in `projects/cursor-trial-effect/images/`.
- Tweak GSAP timings and CSS variables for different visual feels.

Generated by a quick repo cleanup to make the demo runnable without external-hosting issues.
