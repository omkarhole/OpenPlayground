# HTML Components Showcase

A production-ready, developer-centric collection of accessible HTML/CSS components and layout patterns.

Overview
- A single-file showcase demonstrating layout primitives, navigation, cards, accordions, tabs, forms, buttons, toasts, modals, tables, utilities, and more.
- Focuses on accessibility, responsive behavior, and minimal, reusable styles suitable for copying into projects.

Files
- `index.html` — the demo page containing the styles and examples. Open in a browser to preview components.

Usage
- Serve the showcase locally (recommended) and open in your browser:

```bash
# from the repository root
python -m http.server 8000

# then open:
http://localhost:8000/projects/HTML-Components/index.html
```

Notes & Tips
- The demo includes a dark/light theme switch and accessibility-friendly focus styles and live regions.
- Copy isolated component markup and the related CSS into your project; styles are self-contained and documented inline in `index.html`.
