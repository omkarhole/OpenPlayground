<!-- Entire app implemented using GPT-5 and a wild, savage human-vs-LLM back-and-forth battle. Not all that glitters is gold. This is a faithful recreation of my original Sonification Experiment (https://codepen.io/luis-lessrain/pen/pvoELWE). The code needs constant review and refinement.

Ever wondered what sound might be hiding inside a picture? Some 'wild' experiments ago, I built a playful little sound visualizer in JavaScript that turns an image into blocks and lets you "hear" the colors. I’ve always loved mixing visuals and sound in small experiments, because, to me, every image has its own rhythm you don’t see until you listen.

With the new GPT-5 release, I wanted to see how much it could help if I tried to recreate the same project from scratch. My curiosity was mostly about speed, code quality, and having fun with unpredictability. I set it up using a few prompts (Gist with prompts: https://lnkd.in/eWJqMQRD), made adjustments, like refining the block detection so the audio timing stayed locked in, and used trial and error to shape it.

The result works well, feels cleaner, and is easy to adapt. It still needs some optimisation after a human review:

This wasn’t about handing the work over to AI. It was about the process feeling smoother while still being fully involved, choosing how it works, adjusting the settings, and fixing the tricky parts. What really made it fun was the surprise factor. Almost every time I ran the code, something unexpected happened. Sometimes it was a change in the visuals, sometimes an unexpected sound. Each time it happened, it gave me new ideas for tweaks and took the project in directions I had not planned.

It’s not magic, and it doesn’t take away the creativity or the “go wild” element I enjoy. If anything, it opens up more space to experiment.

For the next step, I'm not planning to hand over the code to AI, but I'm interested in integrating some form of AI directly into the system itself. Maybe it could help generate sound textures, create new visual patterns, or bring in some real-time smart tweaks while it runs. Time and AI fatigue will tell... I think it should stay as it is…🤔

-------------------

Update 11/08/2025

- Loads a default example image on startup. Just hit Play without uploading anything.
- Starts with a tweaked Ambient Pad preset: BPM 120, speed ×2, 24 px block grid, for an instant smooth sound.
- Upload still works, so you can try your own images.
- Improved performance after a wild, savage human-vs-LLM back-and-forth battle… with plenty more battles still to fight and win. 🥴
- Makes it easier to explore sound-from-pixels right away without extra setup.
